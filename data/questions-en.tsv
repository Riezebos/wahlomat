Europe needs a common asylum and migration policy	Europe's cultures are too different to have common migration policy. The EU must close people out of the EU legally and if people want to seek asylum they must do so in their home country.	Some member states should not stand alone with the responsibility, while other countries refuse to help or pay off from getting involved. Common boundaries also mean that we must be more solid in the worthy and legal handling of our common boundaries. EU values ​​include respect for human rights and the rule of law - common migration policy means common to asylum applicants and migrants.	4	Volt believes that the EU needs a comprehensive and coherent migration policy that ensures the protection of human rights and respects human dignity. This should include long -term strategies to tackle the causes of migration, secure and legal channels of migration and an effective common European asylum system.  To create a legal migration system, it is crucial to develop a system of European humanitarian corridors that allow better coordination of the actions of Member States. Volt also believes that the development of common Visa opportunities will allow people to get to the EU legally, rather than using human traffickers.  Volt also supports the development of a fully functional European border protection agency that is not Frontex. A border protection agency that provides proper and human receipt of asylum seekers, maintains European values ​​and ensures the security of European residents. This system will maintain the integrity of the EU's borders, fight cross -border crime, create a legal migration system and ensure that human rights are complied with throughout its jurisdiction.  On June 8, Europe's Interior Ministers agreed on an agreement to ensure faster treatment of asylum seekers and more solidarity in Europe. Every year, illegal asylum seekers and migrants come to Europe and Member States have had difficulty agreeing on a common attitude towards the asylum and migration issue. It has led to inhumane conditions for people in Italy and Greece, it has led to illegal migrants in several places in Europe. Europe has common borders and open internal borders. The EU needs to deal with migration better than we have done in the past.
Denmark must support collective agreements in Europe	A politically guaranteed minimum wage ensures that politicians are held responsible for the citizens' way of life and wages. Trade unions can set barriers to the free negotiation.	It has been documented that collective agreements provide the best working conditions for employees. Collective agreements are the most widespread form of organization in Denmark and “The Danish Model” has set a bargaining negotiations among employers and employees.	4	Volt advocates collective agreements because they ensure the best conditions for employees and ensure fair and equal conditions in the workplace. The minimum wage directive strengthens collective agreements throughout Europe and this is the opinion of Volt is good. Volt believes that collective negotiation is an important tool for balancing the negotiating force between workers and employers. It should be available to all workers, including those in non-standard forms of employment such as gig workers.  The EU has made a minimum wage directive that involves citizens of the EU to be covered by a collective agreement:  “One of the goals of the directive is to increase the number of workers covered by collective negotiations on wage fixing. To achieve this goal, countries should promote the ability of the labor market parties to participate in collective negotiations. " https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/adequate-minimum-wages/  In countries whose degree of organization is less than 80% (in Denmark, 76% of employees are covered by a collective agreement) Citizens must be able to count on a fair and life -wage salary that can be a minimum wage, for example. 21 of the EU 27 member states have a minimum wage.
Denmark must remove the euro reservation	At present, the ECB lacks a fiscal mandate, so it does not make sense for Denmark to abandon its fiscal capacity before the euro has as many abilities as the Danish krone.	The Danish krone is already locked in to the euro and therefore it makes sense that we transfer to the euro. Some would say that the mandate of the European Central Bank must be strengthened before Denmark must transfer to the euro.	3	This reservations hold Denmark to use the euro even though the Danish krone is in a fixed rate for the euro. Since 1982, Denmark has had a fixed currency policy against first the German D-mark and then the euro. It is still a reform of the mandate that the European Central Bank has. Today, the European Central Bank, the ECB, has only the right to secure the euro's exchange rate and is therefore not engaged in fiscal policy, only monetary policy. https://www.eu.dk/en/danmark-i-eu/de-danske- Reserves#835B57CB53104C268D33AF8E910A6E72  Volt is in favor of reforming the European Central Bank and strengthening the euro so it becomes a full currency food capacity like the US dollar, British pounds and Japanese yen. When the ECB is reformed, we believe that Denmark should go to the European joint currency.
Eligible age must be lowered to 16	Young people are not ready to vote and should not be praised with difficult decisions.	The criminal age is 15 years. When you can go to jail you must also be allowed to vote!	4	Volt suggests putting the European voting age to 16 to give more attention to the youth voice in the European Parliament elections. Several places in Europe already have the right to vote and Volt wants more votes in democracy!  The demographics make it proportionally more older than young people. In Denmark, 18-30-year-olds make up only 16% of the total population so that a lowered election can cause a change both in focus areas in election campaigns and access to democracy. The Reform Commission has also argued that the electorate should be lowered to 16 years (https://www.altinget.dk/artikel/democratmission-befar-Forsoeg-med-voted-til-16-year-olds)
Europe must have a common European foreign and security policy	All countries must have the right to be able to act independently. We have to act together when it makes sense and we have to act Alne when it makes sense.	When the EU still has a common trade policy and a common defense policy, it also makes sense to have a more coordinated foreign policy.	4	Volt will strengthen the EU's ability to respond collectively to security threats. We advocate for increased defense cooperation and the development of a common defense policy among EU member states. Volt works for strengthening the Service of the EU Foreign Service (EEAS) and turning this into the EU's diplomatic arm. Volt is in favor of a united and coherent EU-Under-Underrige policy. We believe that a common approach to international issues will make the EU more influential on the global stage and ensure that the member states are talking with one voice, because together we are stronger! Human rights, democracy and the rule of law must be at the heart of the EU's interaction with other countries and should control the EU's decision -making processes.  Today, the EU does not have a foreign minister. It is the EU Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who represents the EU externally, but also Josep Borrell, who is a commissioner in charge of coordinating the EU's outward performance on the outside has a foreign policy role. In addition, the EU's foreign ministers meet to coordinate, while national leaders also sometimes take the cases into their own hands when, for example, French Emmannuel Macron travels to China to talk about Ukraine. It can be difficult to know who represents the EU outside.
Denmark must back up for new European Treaty Changes	We do not need more EU. Treaty changes can create too much change.	Many of the ideas that came out of the European Conference - Conference on the Future of Europe - require treaty changes to be implemented. The EU cannot develop as a society if we cannot talk about tractor changes just as we are talking about legislative changes. https://carnegieurope.eu/2022/06/16/does-eu-need-Treaty-change-pub-87330	4	Tract changes are helping to change Europe and we need the EU rules to be updated. Many of the things that citizens of the EU would like to see happen are prevented because the EU treaties are not updated. For example, it takes a treaty change to "stop the travel circus", where the European Parliament travels to Strasbourg every month. The last extensive treaty reform originated in the Lisbon Treaty, which came into force in 2009.  Volt works for changes in the EU Treaties to further integrate Europe and make it more democratic and effective. We support a movement against a federal system and the establishment of a European constitution that replaces existing EU tractates while respecting national sovereignty. The new constitution should detail the fundamental rights and responsibility for EU citizens and institutional events.
Denmark must strengthen the development of nuclear power	There are many who still do not feel confident of nuclear power. Read more about nuclear power at Our World in Data or Follow Associations such as Nuclear Power Yes Thank you that provides fact -based information about nuclear power.	We need stable energy sources that are not fossil fuels. Nuclear power is used throughout Europe in advance and Denmark must join. Wind and sun are not stable energy sources and we cannot continue to burn waste and biomass.	4	Volt wants a CO2 neutral Europe and believes that nuclear power is an essential part of the solution. Nuclear power has previously been a controversial topic in Volt but internal debate has resolved the discrepancies and today the whole of Volt - also in Germany - is prepared that nuclear power is part of our green energy -free time.  Nuclear power is a stable energy source in Energimiksen, which does not produce CO2 during energy production. Nuclear power is produced by the uranium placed in a reactor whose processes operate a turbine that supplies power. Because nuclear power does not produce CO2 during energy production, it is considered one of the safest energy sources as there is no air pollution associated with energy from nuclear power. https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-energy
Denmark must remove border control	Keeping track of who comes into Denmark is more important than Denmark complies with EU Schengen cooperation on open borders.	Border control is a populist grip that does not work, it costs many billions and risks Denmark's role in Schengen cooperation.	4	The Danish border control is illegal and several media have repeatedly uncovered how little effect it has. We need to cooperate with our neighbors to fight crime, but this is not done by maintaining border control. https://www.information.dk/indland/2023/02/smerske-jurists-Danmarks-Graensekontrol-Ulovlig
It is a good idea to strengthen a common European health sector	We should not send patients around Europe. It must be possible to be treated locally.	Today, health is a national area of ​​responsibility in Europe. After Covid19, many people believe it makes sense to gather more things at European level to give patients and staff more options for treatment.	3	It makes sense to collaborate more on treatments and share knowledge and research without compromising on close treatment. Digital solutions and more collaboration can help deliver solutions faster and we will work for that. Volt believes in a universal and affordable health care for all European citizens, where high quality health care is guaranteed. We propose that the optimal public-private coordination and distribution of tasks should be determined on a country-by-country and case-for-case basis. We also aim to invest in e-health programs to improve access to health care and promote efficiency while enforcing evidence-based guidelines and introducing further harmonization of prescriptions and using medicines across countries through the European Medicines Agentu
It should be possible to receive active euthanasia	There are too many ethical dilemmas and they have not been clarified yet.	It must be possible to determine under what circumstances you will no longer live.	4	In Volt we believe in the right to a worthy death. All people are allowed to decide how life should end as long as other people are not unnecessarily affected by this. Therefore, Volt supports passive euthanasia in Denmark. But we at Volt also believe that there are situations where passive euthanasia is not sufficient. Therefore, we support assisted euthanasia, for those who have constant and unbearable physical and/or mental pain. In order to be able to assist euthanasia, we believe that more criteria should meet.
A CO2 tax must be inserted	It is protectionism and destroys global trade when Europe sets up barriers to trade that way.	It makes sense that we tax what we do not want. We need to reduce CO2 emissions, so we need to tax them.	3	Volt believes that a CO2 tax can be an effective market-based mechanism to encourage the transition to a low emission economy. We suggest using the CO2 tax revenue to finance sustainable and climate-friendly projects. We will reinvest the proceeds in renewable energy, green infrastructure as well as research and development of green technologies. We are in favor of a fair transition to a sustainable economy. We believe that a CO2 tax should be implemented in a way that supports vulnerable groups and industries during the transitional period.
Education needs to be strengthened and financed with at least 4% of GDP	We get so much support from the EU and private companies. The state can invest that money elsewhere.	It is the task of the state to educate its citizens and it must be a core task for politicians to secure the country's educational levels	4	We need the public to invest in education for otherwise we will not get research -driven and free research. In an increasing mechanized world, we need more balance between human and technical. In general, Volt wants to invest in education throughout life. Education must be really available for a wider range of students' abilities and talents. We believe in examining long -term trends and updating curricula to be in line with our changing community. We also support the development of new tools and educational parameters. We want to give all children the opportunity to build on their strengths, while ensuring minimum standards and encouraging children to learn through leadership, participation and social awareness.
Denmark must support the development of European transport infrastructure, especially high -speed train	There is plenty of infrastructure, it just needs to be run better and it depends on national train railways.	We need to be able to travel fast and CO2-free. Electrification of our transport sector is one of the major advocates.	4	We need to develop new ways of traveling. Volt is in favor of a broad investment in the transport sector so that we can raise greener and strengthen the electrification of Europe.
Foreign Danes must have stronger rights - it is too difficult to be a Danish abroad today.	Once you have left Denmark, one cannot expect to influence how the country is led.	There are many legislation that are made in Denmark that affect foreign Danes greatly. They must be secured when they have lost their right to vote for election.	3	Any EU citizen who lives in another Member State or temporarily resides in another country must have the opportunity to vote as if they were in the country where they are nationals. This can be done through national embassies or local representations in the European Parliament, provided they register at least 30 days before the vote. EU citizens who live and are legally registered in another Member State may choose whether they will vote in their Member State of Residence or in the Member State where they are nationals. They can only vote in one Member State. If they are temporarily present they should have the opportunity to vote as if they were in the Member State where they are nationals
We have achieved LGBTIQA+ equality and no longer need to have a special focus here	We are all created equally and it is wrong that people are still discriminated against because of their love life. As long as there is discrimination, we need to stay focused on that!	There is enough focus on LGBTIQA+ rights	1	Volt is strongly committed to promoting and protecting LGBTIQ+rights. We believe that all individuals should be treated equally, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation or gender identity. We promote legislation that supports marriage equality, legalizes adoption for couples of the same sex and protects the rights of transgender and inter -gendered. We also believe that the police must be trained in hate crimes against LGBTIQ+people and that companies must be encouraged to train their staff in the subject.
It should be easier to recognize education from EU countries	It creates too much confusion if you do not know what education people have.	We risk losing a lot of potential because we are not good enough to give people the possibility of supplementing their education enough.	4	Volt supports the harmonization of accreditation schemes throughout Europe and a review of the admission requirements for the studies. This includes recognition of foreign education and reward of social engagement skills.
It is a good idea to insert a waiting period into politics to stop the swing doors	Denmark is a small country and if we do not make sure that the best people get the right positions, then it goes badly. People should not be trapped in a job, but should have the opportunity to develop their potential. People are able to separate previous jobs from newer positions.	There are too many politicians jumping from the Folketing to the private and it destroys confidence in the system and political work. It is not good that uncertainty is created about affiliation if politicians, in fact, already while working in Christiansborg, begin to make decisions to get a job in the private than service.	4	Volt believes that swing doors between politics and the private sector can lead to conflicts of interest and undermine public confidence. As part of our obligation to prevent corruption, Volt Stringle requires demands to prevent conflicts of interest, such as revealing revenue sources and attachment to private companies, lobby groups and political parties. We also propose to exclude persons convicted of certain crimes, including corruption and embezzlement, from being selected. We believe it makes sense to maintain a van that corresponds to the period that politicians receive remuneration from the Parliament. When Volt suggests a quarantine period for politicians, we believe that we are in favor of significant cooling periods for officials and elected officials in time between leaving their positions and taking on a new role involving pre-profit advocacy or lobbying. This is to prevent any conflicts of interest that may arise from their previous positions and affiliation, and to ensure that they act in the public interest rather than private interests. Institutional ethical committees must also be created or strengthened to prevent conflicts of interest after public service under stricter ethical guidelines.
There should be more focus on EU policy in the news.	There is too much information and we do not need more channels to confuse the conversation.	We need to understand what is happening directly - not filtered through national agendas.	4	Volt will create pan -European media and spread media content across the EU to create a transnational political space and democracy. We support the cross-border availability of national public service content throughout the EU and will call for an increase in EU support and financing for the training of journalists as well as to quality and study journalism in the EU. Volt believes that it is important to encourage greater media coverage of EU affairs, as well as to encourage the live coverage of national and European parliamentary assemblies of public media, to promote the emergence of a pan-European public sphere. In addition, we seek to support educational measures that strengthen the role of civil society, public institutions and the academic world of distinguishing between credible and false news sources and content.
The doors to the Danish Political System should be opened	We can't have all sorts of crazy parties on the ballot. We need to protect the election action so that only serious parties can be voted on	Today, Denmark has the highest thresholds for participation in democracy. It is a problem for active participation and innovation in democracy.	4	There are swing doors for politicians and barricades for new parties. Denmark has the highest threshold to get on the ballot for the European Parliament elections and it does not benefit the Danish conversation or confidence in the political system.  The crisis of the Danish Democratic System is clear: declining number of members of political parties; Increasing distrust of politicians and demonstrations in the streets.  Danish politicians should not be afraid of getting more parties - there should be real concern about not having enough parties!  To be set up is essential to participate in the public democratic debate. Danish media opt out of non-set-up parties for political debates, which therefore get less talk time, have a harder time getting their ideas heard and therefore harder to gather voter declarations.  No other EU countries require new parties to document all its voters before standing.
Citizens' Collections must be a pervasive tool in policy development	Citizens' collections are a healthy and transparent way where citizens can participate in the democratic conversation.	Citizens' collections remove the power of the politicians and then elections make no sense.	4	Volt supports the implementation of clear mechanisms to trigger a citizen assembly, such as requiring a decisive number of signatures to be reached within a particular time frame. The respective politicians should be held responsible for the implementation of the results of the citizen assemblies. In addition, Volt promotes participation -based budgeting and an increase in financing citizen involvement projects throughout the European civil society sector.  Citizens' collections allow citizens to participate in political decision -making. A diverse group of citizens is randomly selected to address a specific political subject and make informed recommendations through a negotiation process. The results of these assemblies must have a direct influence on the policy or use of local funds, and the process must involve extensive briefings and independent expert input. Their goal is to increase the quality and legitimacy of political decisions.
It is important to strengthen the EU's four freedoms - free movement of people, capital, goods and services.	Before we have secured our external borders and have the necessary resources at European level, we must be prepared to limit the EU's four freedoms. We don't have the resources to deal with all the unforeseen	The free movement creates confidence and builds understanding across the continent. Coordinated security checks, information exchanges and digital tracks make it easier to trace illegalities without preventing the free movement and exchange of knowledge and goods across Europe's borders.	4	EU's four freedoms create unique opportunities for citizens in the EU, but we rarely talk about the rights that EU citizens have as part of the EU's overall goal: to create an even closer union. The four freedoms are under pressure from many sides but it is important to understand what they have meant and will mean for the future of the EU and Europe.
